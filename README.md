# aoc2021

tricks in the name. My attempts at advent of code 2021. Can't promise the solutions will be good, but they'll work!

Note some of these will only solve part 2 if I'm too lazy to keep p1 around and instead just bastardize it to solve part 2.

I'm also trying to not spend too much time on this, whatever gets me over the finish line fastest is what gets dumped on here so look forward to bad code.
